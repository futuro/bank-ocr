* Bank OCR Coding Challenge
  This project follows the challenge laid out in
  http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/. It currently covers User Stories 1
  through 3, with a test namespace for each, except that
  ~software.justenough.bank-ocr.core/process-file~ doesn't write anything to a
  file like User Story 3 mentions, because there was no need, and a simple call
  to ~(spit "filename" ...)~ would suffice.
* Testing approach
  I chose [[https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha][Kaocha]] to handle the tests, because I'd read about it in a Clojurists
  Together update and wanted to see what it was all about. You can try it out by
  running ~bin/kaocha.sh~, which should Do The Right Thing (TM).

  I've got one test namespace per User Story, as that seemed logical given the
  layout of the coding exercise, but I could have relied simply on the tests for
  User Story 3 as well, as that exercises the same code as the tests for stories
  1 and 2, and I was writing integration tests.
