* Kaocha Testing framework
** Why?
   I wanted to add a small amount of testing to this project, and learning
   Kaocha seemed like a good way to go about doing that.

** Configuration
   [[https://cljdoc.org/d/lambdaisland/kaocha/0.0-389/doc/3-configuration][See the config docs]] for a breakdown on every option, but here are the ones
   I'm going to rely on inside the ~:tests~ key.
   * ~:id~: What is the particular test config map called
   * ~:test-paths~: Where to find the test clj files
   * ~:source-paths~: Where the source is held
   * ~:ns-patterns~: What namespace should qualify as a test namespace to run
